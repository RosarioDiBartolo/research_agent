🧠 AdvancedResearchAgent
An autonomous, iterative research system powered by LLMs and web search. It performs deep, multi-step research on complex topics, continuously refining its understanding and synthesizing knowledge from authoritative sources.

🚀 Features
🔄 Iterative Research Loop — Refines results over multiple passes for thorough exploration

🎯 Strategic Search Planning — Uses LLMs to craft targeted search queries

📚 Summarization and Integration — Merges new findings with existing summaries

🧠 Key Concept Extraction — Identifies statutes, legal principles, names, dates, terms

🧪 Research Completeness Assessment — Checks for depth, authority, and coverage

📈 Progress Tracking — Logs each iteration’s metadata (sources, summary length, time)

🧰 Pluggable Search Tool — Uses Tavily or other LangChain-compatible tools

📦 Installation
bash
Copia
Modifica
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research_agent.git
cd research_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
⚙️ Environment Setup
Before running the agent, create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

env
Copia
Modifica
# Required for web search (Tavily is always used)
TAVILY_API_KEY=A2ef2...

# Example model API key (Gemini). Replace with your chosen model's key if different.
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
Note:
This project supports multiple LLM backends. GEMINI_API_KEY is shown as an example. You may configure other models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) based on your use case. The system is modular and designed to plug in different providers.

🧑‍💻 Usage
bash
Copia
Modifica
python -m main
🔧 Model Configuration (Optional)
By default, the system detects available API keys and selects the appropriate model. You can override this by specifying the model provider and configuration in a config file or environment variable.
